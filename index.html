  YES YOU!
  YOU NOSY LITTLE CUNT! 
  REAL CLEVER ARE YOU?
  LOOKING AT THIS HERE CODE TRYING TO BE SMART "OH I CAN CODE TOO I WONDER HOW IT LOOKS"
  WELL FUCK YOU
  I MADE THIS IN A REAL SIMPLE WAY FOR A REASON
  I COULDNT GIVE LESS OF A SHIT IF YOU POINT OUT 30 REASONS HOW IT CAN BE IMPROVED AND HOW IT COULD BE DONE BETTER
  YOU CAN STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE
  THIS WAS MADE TO FIT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXPERTISE, MEEK HAS NOT RECEIVED A CODING WORKSHOP ON THE LEVEL OF YOUR "IMPROVEMENTS"
  SO PLEASE KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF, JUST LOOK AT THE PRETTY PICTURES AND DONT THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT

  FUCK YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
